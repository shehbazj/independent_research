# CSC494 - Assignment 3

Submission Instructions:<br/>
Your first task is to go through the applications and workloads. For each group, one team member should read, understand and install the application. The other team member should read, understand and install benchmark. Please bring a summary of things you understand about the application and the benchmark in class for discussion tomorrow. <br/>

You will then be working on the dm-trace part of the assignment. At the end of the assignment, you will submit the instructions to install applications and benchmarks, and fio performance comparision with dm-trace, with blktrace and without any tracing tool.

Submission Date: Nov 23, 5PM

Let us know if you need more time.

## Applications

In this assignment, we will run custom applications. This is group specific. Your task is to study and tell us what these applications do and how these applications run. Your task is also to understand various benchmarks and write instructions to setup, install and run each of these applications and corresponding benchmarks on a Ubuntu Machine. For each application, there is the application itself that runs on the server. There is a benchmark that acts as a client.

### TPCC+ and mysql

Group : Bryan and KC

Read about TPC+ and mysql.<br/>
https://github.com/oltpbenchmark/oltpbench<br/>
https://github.com/Percona-Lab/tpcc-mysql<br/>
https://www.percona.com/blog/2010/02/08/introducing-tpce-like-workload-for-mysql/<br/>

Install and run OLTPBench with MySQL on the VM.
Document Instructions to install MySQL.

### Spark + SparkBench

Group : Yuhan and Fukka

Install Spark on your VM. Install different workloads that exist for the application. <br/>
https://codait.github.io/spark-bench/workloads/<br/>
Document installation and run instructions.<br/>
Talk about this in class for a few minutes. <br/>

### YCSB + Cassandra/RocksDB

Group : Jialun and Tony

Install and run YCSB with Cassandra and/or RocksDB. YCSB contains 6 (or more?) workloads.<br/>

https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Core-Workloads<br/>
https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Running-a-Workload<br/>

Read about Cassandra and/or RocksDB, install and run YCSB and document setup instructions.<br/>

## dm-trace

In this assignment, you will be running a customized device mapper module. The module is already being given to you so you would (hopefully) not have to make any modifications. the module can be accessed [here](https://github.com/shehbazj/independent_research/tree/master/hw3/dm-trace): 
It consists of the following four files:
- Makefile
- dm-trace.c - a trace file that intercepts all reads and writes between the file system and the disk.
- starter.sh - a shell script that would format your file system, create a device mapper, mount the device mapper.
- cleanup.sh - a shell script that would remove your file system.

NOTE: the script/code has been minimally tested with ext4, please report any issues that you may face to the TA while setting up the device mapper tool.

- Copy all four files in one folder.
- run `make`. Let us know if things dont compile.
- run ./setup.sh and provide the workload device name, file system type and device size(in GB). let us know if things don't work.
- run a simple dd command, write 4KB x 10 blocks, see if the writes you observe correspond to your understanding of the file system. run this for each of the 3 file systems.

- Run fio for upto 10 mins. Fill the 20 GB workload disk. Collect the output of the dm-trace tool.
- Re - run your blktrace for 10 mins with the same setup configuration. Collect the output of the dm-trace tool.
- Re - run fio again for 10 mins, again with the same setup. this time do not use any trace tool.
- Draw a graph for each of the 3 file systems comparing the overheads of blktrace v/s dm-trace. They should compare both throughput and iops you compared in the last assignment.

NOTE: Again, if you see dm-trace crashes or setup.sh script does not work, please email the TA
